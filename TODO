* #231824: i8kutils: Emulate 2.4 "multimedia keys" behaviour for 2.6
  - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=231824
* Add support for multiple temperature sensors and variable number of fans.
* Change i8kmon 'timer' to use a thread with sleep command in order to avoid creating many threads all over process life.
* Update docs to say that i8kmon is always in daemon mode, and that does not exist --daemon -d options anymore.
