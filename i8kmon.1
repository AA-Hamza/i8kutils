.SH "NAME"
i8kmon \- a monitor for fan control on Dell laptops based on cpu temperature
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
i8kmon [\fI<options>\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The i8kmon is a daemon to monitor the cpu temperature and control the
fan status on Dell laptops. It does that by means of regularly reading the
system temperature, and choosing apropriate state (speed) of the fan biased
on a table.
.LP
Inside i8kmon there is a default table of thresholds with the values below
.LP
    set config(0) {{0 0}  -1  60  -1  65}
    set config(1) {{1 0}  50  70  55  75}
    set config(2) {{1 1}  60  80  65  85}
    set config(3) {{2 2}  70 128  75 128}
.LP
This table can be customized at '/etc/i8kmon.conf', which will be read everytime
i8kmon service starts.
.LP
In fact, the monitor will run in background as a daemon if the option
\fB\-\-daemon\fR is given. The i8kmon is just started in the background by default
it is invoked as a service in Debian and derivated OSes.
.LP
If no option is given, the program just monitors the cpu temperature.
The automatic control can be enabled manually with the \fB\-\-auto\fR option.
.LP
i8kutils was not designed to discover the type of fan a Dell system has.
.LP
You can discover which fans exist using 'i8kfan'. Issue
.LP
    $ i8kfan 0 0
.LP
to turn the fans off. Then issue
.LP
    $ i8kfan 2 -
.LP
to try to turn on the left fan. If you hear some sound, then the left fan exist.
Repeat the steps with '$ i8kfan 0 0; i8kfan - 2' to discover if the right fan
exist.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
The program accepts the following command\-line options:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-auto\fR
Monitor cpu temperature and fan status and control
automatically the fans.
.TP
\fB\-na\fR, \fB\-\-noauto\fR
Monitor cpu temperature and fan status but don't control
automatically the fans. This is the default setting.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemon\fR
Run the program in daemon mode, i.e. without the user
interface.
.TP
\fB\-nd\fR, \fB\-\-nodaemon\fR
Don't run the program in daemon mode, i.e. open the user
interface. This is the default setting.
.TP
\fB\-nc\fR, \fB\-\-nouserconfig\fR
Don't attempt to source the ~/.i8kmon configfile, only /etc/i8kmon.conf.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report hardware status and program actions on stdout.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-geometry\fR <\fIgeometry\fP>
Specifies the geometry of the applet window. Geometry should
be 24x24, 36x36 or 48x48 to fit the size of the gnome panel.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR <\fIseconds\fP>
Specifies the interval at which the daemon checks the
hardware status. Useful values are in the range of 1\-5
seconds. Default is 2 seconds.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unit\fR C|F
Specifies the temperature display unit. Default is C (Celsius).
This option affects only the value shown in the applet. All other
temperature values are always in Celsius.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.LP
The program has builtin defaults to temperature thresholds but users can
specify their own settings in configuration files /etc/i8kmon.conf and
~/.i8kmon. It is also possible to specify values to others internal variables
that change the behavior of i8kmon.
.LP
The variables and values are as follows.
.TP
\fBset config(sysconfig)\fR   /etc/i8kmon.conf
System configuration file
.TP
\fBset config(userconfig)\fR  ~/.i8kmon
User configuration file
.TP
\fBset config(i8kfan)\fR  /usr/bin/i8kfan
i8kfan executable path
.TP
\fBset config(acpi)\fR    "acpi"
Filename of the apci executable
.TP
\fBset config(geometry)\fR    {}
Geometry of applet
.TP
\fBset config(use_conf)\fR    1
Set whether user configuration file must be read or not
.TP
\fBset config(auto)\fR    1
Set i8kmon behavior to auto
.TP
\fBset config(daemon)\fR  1
Load i8kmon as a daemon
.TP
\fBset config(verbose)\fR 0
Print verbose logs
.TP
\fBset config(timeout)\fR 5
Timeout
.TP
\fBset config(unit)\fR    C
Unit of measure
.TP
\fBset config(t_high)\fR  80
Maximum high temperature
.TP
\fBset config(min_speed)\fR   2000
Minimum speed
.LP
The following variables and values do not exist with default values, they are
probed at every startup of i8kmon service. If these variables are set at config
file, i8kmon will not probe for them. These variable avoid i8kmon turn on fans
at max speed at every startup which, for some users, is a annoying behavior.
.TP
\fBset status(leftspeed)\fR   "0 1000 2000 3000"
Speed values (rpm) of left fan at velocities 0, 1, 2, 3
.TP
\fBset status(rightspeed)\fR   "0 1000 2000 3000"
Speed values (rpm) of right fan at velocities 0, 1, 2, 3
.LP
The daemon defines 4 states with different fan speeds ({0 0}, {1 0}, {1 1},
{2 2}) and for each state are defined the temperature thresholds which cause
the switching to a higher or lower state. Furthermore each state can have
different thresholds for operation on ac power or battery.
For example the following configuration:
.IP
set config(0) {{0 0}  \-1  60  \-1  65}
.br
set config(1) {{1 0}  50  70  55  75}
.br
set config(2) {{1 1}  60  80  65  85}
.br
set config(3) {{2 2}  70 128  75 128}
.LP
defines state 0 with both fans off, high threshold of 60 degrees (65 on
battery) and low threshold \-1, which is actually never reached since 0 is the
lowest state. When the high threshold is reached the program switches to state
1 (left low, right off) which has a high threshold of 70 degrees and a low
threshold of 50 degrees. If the temperature drops below 50 the program will
switch back to state 0, if it rises above 70 it will enter state 2, and so on.
For better operation the temperature ranges should be overlapping with an
hysteresis of at least 10 degrees, i.e. 1={50 70},2={60 80} is better than
1={50 70},2={70 80}. It must be remembered that the low threshold of state 0
must be \-1 and the high threshold of state 3 must be 128.
.LP
If the laptop has only one fan, it is better to specify a '-' instead of the fan
speed of the missing fan. For example:
.IP
set config(2) {{1 -}  60  80  65  85}
.LP
If you want to use it as a daemon you must create
the config file yourself. In this case, the \fB\-\-nouserconfig\fR option
can sometimes also help by limiting it to sourcing /etc/i8kmon.conf (and not
~/.i8kmon).
